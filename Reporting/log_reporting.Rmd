1. Solved the problem to import the data **Original_odor_relations.JSON**: **wrongly parsed**. 
  + R does not reported the line in which there was a mistake,  so was not possible to identify *in site* the nature of the issue. only points that trails gargabe.

 + Used [https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer](https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer) as a tool to 
 track an arrange the JSON data, identified the problem in **line 18282**, there were ][ symbols 
 placed in the middle of the JSON structure.
 
 + The data was no duplicated, it seems that only misstracked something in the process of its creation.


2. Added the **compounds.csv** dataset to the environment, linked by the *cid* variable
